# McGill-COMP302-Programming-Languages-and-Paradigms

In this project, I implemented a language called MiniML, in OCaml, as part of the final project of COMP 302: Programming Languages and Paradigms. 

The goal was to gain a deeper understanding on key concepts such as free variables, substitution, evaluation, type checking and type inference. 

MiniML is similar to OCaml itself. 
In particular, it includes n-ary tuples (pairs written as (e1, . . . , en)), a general let-expression, functions, function application, and recursion.
